      <description>I started CS50 a couple weeks ago, with a goal of getting it done during this second round of #100DaysOfCode, but with the Web Summit and job-hunting and trying to complete two freeCodeCamp certifications, I kind of let CS50 slide.
What is CS50 CS50 is Harvard&amp;rsquo;s University intro to Computer Science, that I am taking for free as a self-paced course through EdX.
As a front end web developer I don&amp;rsquo;t really need to know computer science concepts to do my job.</description>
