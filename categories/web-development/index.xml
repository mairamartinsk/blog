      <description>Today I was trying to decide what content to write about, when I accidently highlighted some text on my own blog.
Normally, the background color of the highlighted portion shows up in blue, in the same shade as the browser&amp;rsquo;s default focus color. While this is not a bad thing at all, I would prefer it to match my color palette (black, yellow, white).
Never having styled a highlight before, I set out to discover how to do it and, 60 seconds later, it was done!</description>

      <description>I came home a few days ago from my first tech conference, Web Summit 2018, and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share my thoughts about it from the point of view of a newcomer to the industry.
It is crazy!
I&amp;rsquo;ve been to large photography conferences before, but Web Summit is massive in a whole different scale. I&amp;rsquo;m talking almost 70.000 attendees, 3 full-days of talks and workshops, a ton of startups, and people of the caliber of Tony Blair and Tim Berners-Lee giving presentations.</description>
