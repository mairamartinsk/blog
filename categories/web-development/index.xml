      <title>CS50, an intro to Computer Science</title>

      <description>I started CS50 a couple weeks ago, with a goal of getting it done during this second round of #100DaysOfCode, but with the Web Summit and job-hunting and trying to complete two freeCodeCamp certifications, I kind of let CS50 slide.
What is CS50 CS50 is Harvard&amp;rsquo;s University intro to Computer Science, that I am taking for free as a self-paced course through EdX.
As a front end web developer I don&amp;rsquo;t really need to know computer science concepts to do my job.</description>

      <title>Style Highlighted Text with CSS</title>
      <link>https://mairamartins.com/blog/css-selection/</link>

      <description>Today I was trying to decide what content to write about, when I accidently highlighted some text on my own blog.
Normally, the background color of the highlighted portion shows up in blue, in the same shade as the browser&amp;rsquo;s default focus color. While this is not a bad thing at all, I would prefer it to match my color palette (black, yellow, white).
Never having styled a highlight before, I set out to discover how to do it and, 60 seconds later, it was done!</description>

      <title>The Best Podcasts for Beginner Developers</title>

      <description>It took me a long time to enjoy the idea of listening to programming podcasts. Since for the past year I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying so many hours (30h to 40h/week), I really wanted to use my podcast time to disconnect.
As a beginner, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to feel overwhelmed by everything you don&amp;rsquo;t know. I still prefer to listen to podcasts about everything else, but when I want to learn about web development, those are my go-to shows.</description>

      <title>Web Summit 2018</title>

      <description>I came home a few days ago from my first tech conference, Web Summit 2018, and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share my thoughts about it from the point of view of a newcomer to the industry.
It is crazy!
I&amp;rsquo;ve been to large photography conferences before, but Web Summit is massive in a whole different scale. I&amp;rsquo;m talking almost 70.000 attendees, 3 full-days of talks and workshops, a ton of startups, and people of the caliber of Tony Blair and Tim Berners-Lee giving presentations.</description>
