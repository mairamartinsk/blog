      <description>Since I discovered the world of podcasts in early 2015, my consumption of music has declined steadily.
Podcasts became my go-to source of general knowledge and entertainment and are a big part of my daily routine. I can’t listen to them if I’m at the computer though. I forget I’m listening to them and seem to focus only on the screen in front of me. Rewinding does nothing, as within 3 seconds I stop listening again.</description>

      <description>This is my second attempt at a programming blog. The first time was about a year ago, right when I first started to learn web development and unfortunately I was overcome with impostor syndrome and ended up deleting all the posts. I kinda regret that I didn&amp;rsquo;t keep at it. It would have been so nice to go back and read about my many discoveries and challenges.
(You hear that, reader from the future?</description>
