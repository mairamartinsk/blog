      <description>This is my second attempt at a programming blog. The first time was about a year ago, right when I first started to learn web development and unfortunately I was overcome with impostor syndrome and ended up deleting all the posts. I kinda regret that I didn&amp;rsquo;t keep at it. It would have been so nice to go back and read about my many discoveries and challenges.
(You hear that, reader from the future?</description>
