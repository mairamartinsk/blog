      <title>Style Highlighted Text with CSS</title>

      <description>Today I was trying to decide what content to write about, when I accidently highlighted some text on my own blog.
Normally, the background color of the highlighted portion shows up in blue, in the same shade as the browser&amp;rsquo;s default focus color. While this is not a bad thing at all, I would prefer it to match my color palette (black, yellow, white).
Never having styled a highlight before, I set out to discover how to do it and, 60 seconds later, it was done!</description>

      <title>The Best Podcasts for Beginner Developers</title>

      <description>It took me a long time to enjoy the idea of listening to programming podcasts. Since for the past year I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying so many hours (30h to 40h/week), I really wanted to use my podcast time to disconnect.
As a beginner, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to feel overwhelmed by everything you don&amp;rsquo;t know. I still prefer to listen to podcasts about everything else, but when I want to learn about web development, those are my go-to shows.</description>

      <title>The Best Podcasts About Everything</title>

      <description>Since I discovered the world of podcasts in early 2015, my consumption of music has declined steadily.
Podcasts became my go-to source of general knowledge and entertainment and are a big part of my daily routine. I can’t listen to them if I’m at the computer though. I forget I’m listening to them and seem to focus only on the screen in front of me. Rewinding does nothing, as within 3 seconds I stop listening again.</description>

      <title>Web Summit 2018</title>

      <description>I came home a few days ago from my first tech conference, Web Summit 2018, and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share my thoughts about it from the point of view of a newcomer to the industry.
It is crazy!
I&amp;rsquo;ve been to large photography conferences before, but Web Summit is massive in a whole different scale. I&amp;rsquo;m talking almost 70.000 attendees, 3 full-days of talks and workshops, a ton of startups, and people of the caliber of Tony Blair and Tim Berners-Lee giving presentations.</description>

      <description>This is my second attempt at a programming blog. The first time was about a year ago, right when I first started to learn web development and unfortunately I was overcome with impostor syndrome and ended up deleting all the posts. I kinda regret that I didn&amp;rsquo;t keep at it. It would have been so nice to go back and read about my many discoveries and challenges.
(You hear that, reader from the future?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Maira, a Brazilian/Swedish web developer living in Barcelona. Lover of CSS, dogs, sushi and React.js (in no order of preference).
 My passion for web development started at age 15 (back in the year 2000, yo!), when I bought a &amp;ldquo;How to Build a Website - For Dummies&amp;rdquo; book. From that moment on, my life got filled with iframes, inline styles and a unique design that can only be described as a mix of brutalism and minimalism at the same time.</description>
