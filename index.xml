      <description>Hugo is the world’s fastest static website engine. It’s written in Go (aka Golang) and developed by bep, spf13 and friends. From the project&amp;rsquo;s readme:
 Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in Go. It is optimized for speed, ease of use, and configurability. Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website.
Hugo relies on Markdown files with front matter for metadata, and you can run Hugo from any directory.</description>
