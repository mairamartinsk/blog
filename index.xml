      <description>This is my second attempt at a programming blog. The first time was about a year ago, right when I first started to learn web development and unfortunately I was overcome with impostor syndrome and ended up deleting all the posts. I kinda regret that I didn&amp;rsquo;t keep at it. It would have been so nice to go back and read about my many discoveries and challenges.
(You hear that, reader from the future?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Maira, a Brazilian/Swedish web developer living in Barcelona. Lover of CSS, dogs, sushi and React.js (in no order of preference).
 My passion for web development started at age 15, when I bought a &amp;ldquo;How to Build a Website - For Dummies&amp;rdquo; book. From that moment on, my life got filled with iframes, inline styles and a unique design that can only be described as a mix of brutalism and minimalism at the same time.</description>
