      <description>I came home a few days ago from my first tech conference, Web Summit 2018, and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share my thoughts about it from the point of view of a newcomer to the industry.
It is crazy!
I&amp;rsquo;ve been to large photography conferences before, but Web Summit is massive in a whole different scale. I&amp;rsquo;m talking almost 70.000 attendees, 3 full-days of talks and workshops, a ton of startups, and people of the caliber of Tony Blair and Tim Berners-Lee giving presentations.</description>

      <description>This is my second attempt at a programming blog. The first time was about a year ago, right when I first started to learn web development and unfortunately I was overcome with impostor syndrome and ended up deleting all the posts. I kinda regret that I didn&amp;rsquo;t keep at it. It would have been so nice to go back and read about my many discoveries and challenges.
(You hear that, reader from the future?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Maira, a Brazilian/Swedish web developer living in Barcelona. Lover of CSS, dogs, sushi and React.js (in no order of preference).
 My passion for web development started at age 15, when I bought a &amp;ldquo;How to Build a Website - For Dummies&amp;rdquo; book. From that moment on, my life got filled with iframes, inline styles and a unique design that can only be described as a mix of brutalism and minimalism at the same time.</description>
