This is my second attempt at a programming blog. The first time was about a year ago, right when I first started to learn web development and unfortunately I was overcome with impostor syndrome and ended up deleting all the posts. I kinda regret that I didn't keep at it. It would have been so nice to go back and read about my many discoveries and challenges.

_(You hear that, reader from the future? If you are a beginner and thinking to start a blog, do it. And don't delete it!)_

Now I'm one year into my journey and I'm about to succeed at the **career change** I've been dreaming about!

I'm interviewing for front end positions, I have been to my first tech conference, I even made my first dev friends IRL! I have finally reached a point where I feel confident presenting myself to others as "Maira, web developer", instead of "Maira, photographer". As a consequence, I feel much more confident about blogging too.

I really want to claim a corner of the internet to call my own.

> So, hello world. Welcome!

I plan on publishing a new post every week. There will be study notes. There will be tutorials. There will be course reviews, and book reviews, and tech conference reviews. here will be tons of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There will be typos. Heck, there might even be terrible mistakes!

Let's do this! ‚ù§

**Note:** There _won't_ be any hate and trolling though, which is why I am not enabling comments on the blog. Let's bring the discussion to Twitter and Linkedin, like this more people can join in and contribute with high-quality comments. // Also, if you find typos or even a huge code error, please send me an email, tweet or open a github issue and help me fix it. I am here to learn and I will be forever grateful for your _kind_ contributions.
