Week 1 of [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x "CS50 course oage on EdX") is an introduction to the programming language **C**, using the concepts learned last week with Scratch (a graphical tool to help learn programming).

Since I started learning programming one year ago, I decided to focus on JavaScript, simply because this is the most common web development language today (and there are more jobs for it). But I always knew I wanted to learn other languages, and on the top of my list I had Python and Ruby. Turns out I started with **C**, during this Lecture.

One of the most exciting things, for me, was to see how the knowledge I have on JavaScript translates to C very intuitively -- and probably translates to other programming languages too.

I love the idea of a shared "grammar" of sorts between programming languages, much like we have a certain shared grammar between Latin languages (the roots of the words, the verbs, the pronouns). If you already know Spanish, you would need to learn new vocabulary and some things are written/said in a totally different way but, in general, you can feel this is the same linguistic family and this helps a lot when learning a second language.

Maybe there are completely weird programming languages out there, just like Portuguese and Japanese have nothing in common. But from what I have seen so far, between JavaScript and C (and the very little I've seen of Python and Ruby), they are all somehow related.

## Lecture 1: Intro to C

[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "Article about C on Wikipedia") is one of the most used programming languages of all times, and it has been around since 1972.

It uses some keywords such as `if/else`, `for`, `while`, `switch` and that made me feel right at home, as at a glance I knew what that code block was doing. Happy to report in the field of for loops, while loops, if/else conditionals etc., it all works pretty much like JS.

However, unlike JavaScript, **C** seems much more conservative, as in, you need to import libraries to make the simplest things work and you can't just initialize a variable with `var thing = 'thing!';`.

In **C**, you need to initialize your variables according to the specific **type** of value it will hold. Hpwever, the CS50 course includes a _cs50.h_ library to be imported on our C projects that add a ton of functionality including getting user input and initializing variables with, for example,`int` for integers, `float` for floating points and `string` for text.

Another big difference between JS and **C** is it needs to be compiled. This means that the computer does not automatically understand your code, so it needs to be converted to machine code (binary) before things work.

## Lecture 2: 

This week's content was massive and included a second Lecture, over 1h40min long.

First, prof. Malan explained a bit of the low-level of compiling **C** code into binary. Then, using **Super Mario Bros.** he brilliantly introduces the idea of debugging code, while at the same time teaching about scope.
