It took me a long time to enjoy the idea of listening to programming podcasts. Since for the past year I've been studying so many hours (30h to 40h/week), I really wanted to use my podcast time to disconnect.

As a beginner, it's easy to feel overwhelmed by everything you don't know. I still prefer to listen to [podcasts](/blog/best-podcasts/) about everything else, but when I want to learn about web development, those are my go-to shows.

### Syntax

Hosted by Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski, this is definitely one of the most practical podcasts I've ever listened to. Packed with good advice, this show is excellent for beginner front end developers who want to undestand JavaScript better, and get tips about workflow and productivity.

### Base.cs

Even though most of us, self-taught beginners, are not planning to go back to university and get a full CS degree, it's still important to at least get familiar with Computer Science concepts. It really helps to understand how things work and why programming languages work the way they do.

The Base.CS podcast is _brilliant_ in that sense. Started by Vaidehi Joshi as a series of blog posts, this show teaches basic CS concepts in a really easy way to understand. Every episode is a must!

### Code Newbie

Code Newbie is hosted by Saron Yitbarek and each episode brings either stories of people who changed careers into development or interesting content about freelancing, technical interviews, databases, tests etc.

## Bonus: intermediate level developers

### Front End Happy Hour

On this show, engineers from Netflix, Evernote, LinkedIn, etc. talk over drinks about all things front end.

### JavaScript Jabber

I just started listening to this one. It focuses on JavaScript both on the front and the back end.
