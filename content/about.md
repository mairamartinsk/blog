> I'm Maira, a Brazilian/Swedish web developer living in Barcelona. Lover of CSS, dogs, sushi and React.js (in no order of preference).

My passion for web development started at age 15 (back in the year 2000, yo!), when I bought a "How to Build a Website - For Dummies" book. From that moment on, my life got filled with iframes, inline styles and a unique design that can only be described as a mix of brutalism and minimalism at the same time. For example, [this](http://varzeacap.byethost7.com/ "Maracatu Varzea do Capibaribe").

Professionally, I worked for a good decade first as a cinema & tv video editor and later as a (pretty good) wedding photographer, before deciding to quit everything and change careers.

I am a self-taught developer and a full-time programming student since October 2017. I am super dedicated and have consistently logged about 30-40 hours a week of study time (still, the more I learn, the more I realize I know nothing).

I really went _from zero to hero_ during this year or so. I now use Sass, write super well-commented stylesheets, rock my html5 semantics, and can create silly javascript [memory games](https://curved-transport.surge.sh/). I even won a google scholarship for a Udacity Front End Nanodegree, after competing with **200k students**!

I'm really proud of what I have achieved so far, and I hope to achieve so much more.

> Hello! Is it me you're looking for?

Well, then let's talk. I'm open for remote or Barcelona-based frontend positions.
