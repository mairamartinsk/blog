      <description>Since I discovered the world of podcasts in early 2015, my consumption of music has declined steadily.
Podcasts became my go-to source of general knowledge and entertainment and are a big part of my daily routine. I can’t listen to them if I’m at the computer though. I forget I’m listening to them and seem to focus only on the screen in front of me. Rewinding does nothing, as within 3 seconds I stop listening again.</description>

      <description>I came home a few days ago from my first tech conference, Web Summit 2018, and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share my thoughts about it from the point of view of a newcomer to the industry.
It is crazy!
I&amp;rsquo;ve been to large photography conferences before, but Web Summit is massive in a whole different scale. I&amp;rsquo;m talking almost 70.000 attendees, 3 full-days of talks and workshops, a ton of startups, and people of the caliber of Tony Blair and Tim Berners-Lee giving presentations.</description>
